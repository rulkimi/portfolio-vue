### ðŸŒŸ Personal Portfolio Website (Using Vue Js)

- My personal portfolio website design was inspired by the fantastic tutorial on [Bedimcode's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Bedimcode). I use Vue Js instead to practice my Vue Js knowledge.
- I've added my unique style and details to make it my own.
- The portfolio includes both light and dark themes, along with captivating scroll animations.
- It features a user-friendly form for sending emails.
- I initially developed it with the Mobile-First approach, ensuring compatibility with all mobile devices.
- I later extended the design to the desktop, creating a seamless user interface.
